# Predicting Fluorescence Emission Wavelengths and Quantum Yields via Machine Learning


Prediction of fluorescence emission wavelengths and quatum yields for organic molecules may represent a key step for identification of potential auto-flourescence (AF). During High-throughput Screening (HTS) campaigns using fluorescence-based readouts, AF is a common interference to be taken into account. Here, there is a ready-to-use implementation of the models reported by [Souza et al.](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.4c02403), derived from the jupyter notebooks deposited in the original [repository](https://github.com/Quimica-Teorica-IME/Predicting-Fluorescence-Emission-Wavelengths-and-Quantum-Yields-via-Machine-Learning).
